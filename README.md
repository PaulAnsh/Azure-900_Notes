# Azure-900_Notes
Repo- Documenting my azure-900 notes. 


## Intro
     
  AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
  
  Cloud concepts: 25-30%
  Azure Architechure and services: 35-40%
  Azure management and governance 30-35%
  
  
Azure: It is a private and public platform used to build, deploy and manage applications.

Azure uses virtualization. Virtualization seprates the tight coupling betwee computer cpu and its operating system, using abstraction layer called Hypervisor. Hypervisor emulates all the functions of CPU and a real computer in a virtual machine. 

## Basics of how Azure works:

 ## Cloud Models:
  
  It is deployment type of cloud resources:
   1. Private Cloud
   2. Public Cloud
   3. Hybrid Cloud
   
   
   Private Cloud: It is a cloud that is used by single entity. Finally, a procate clpud may be hosted from your dedicated datacenter offsite. Potenitally even by a        third partty that has dedicated that datacenter to your company. 
   
   Public Cloud: A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud-provider. With public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. 
   
   Hybrid Cloud: A htbrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private cloud in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. 
   
   Multi-Cloud: Using multiple cloud providers and dealing two or more public cloud providers and manage resources. 
   
   Azure Arc: It is a set of technology that helps manage your cloud environment. It helps with cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid config, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once. 
   

## The Consumption-based model

   There are two types of expenses consider. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and operational expediture (opEX). 
   
   CapEx:
   1. one time, up-front expenditure to secure resources. 
   2. eg: Building, Company vehicles, Building datacenter. 
   
   OpEx:
   1. Spending money on services or on products over time. 
   2. Renting convention center, leasing a company vehicle or siging cloud services. 
   
   Cloud computing falls under OpEX because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model, with cloud computing, you don't pay for physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaing a datacenter. 
   
 ## Benefits for consumption-based model
 
 1. No upfront costs.
 2. No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructre that users might not use. 
 3. The ability to pay for more resources when needed. 
 
 ## Cloud Benefits
     
 1. High Availabilty
 2. Fault Tolerance
 3. Scalabilty
 4. Global reach
 5. Agility
 6. Elasticity
 7. Customer latency capabilites
 8. Predictive Cost Consideration. 
 
 ## Core Azure Services: 
 
 Region Pairs: Region pair is used to replicate data in two regions. eg: us west and us east. 
 
Azure compute: Azure compute is a service which provides on-demand computing services for cloud based applications. Such as: Computing resources, for instance, processors, memory, storage, os, networking. Listed below are the services provided with Azure Compute Services.
Azure App Service
Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Container Instances
Azure Functions (or serverless computing)

1. Azure App service: Azure app service is used for deploying enterprise applications for web and mobile. It is easily scaled with complaint requirements, secuirty and performance assured that is managed by azure platform. It falls under Paas. 

2. Azure Virtual Machines:
