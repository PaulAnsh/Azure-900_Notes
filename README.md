Azure: It is a private and public platform used to build, deploy and manage applications.

Azure uses virtualization. Virtualization seprates the tight coupling betwee computer cpu and its operating system, using abstraction layer called Hypervisor. Hypervisor emulates all the functions of CPU and a real computer in a virtual machine.

 ## Cloud Models:
  
  It is deployment type of cloud resources:
   1. Private Cloud
   2. Public Cloud
   3. Hybrid Cloud
   
   
   Private Cloud: It is a cloud that is used by single entity. Finally, a procate clpud may be hosted from your dedicated datacenter offsite. Potenitally even by a        third partty that has dedicated that datacenter to your company. 
   
   Public Cloud: A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud-provider. With public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. 
   
   Hybrid Cloud: A htbrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private cloud in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources.
